# What does a BMS / Automation OPM do?

What does a BMS / Automation OPM do? We advise and guide from basis of design through commissioning and final documentation, so the job is completed with quality, not just done.
 
Audit - For existing systems, we understand what is in place, and ensure new technology is implemented. If there are deficiencies in the automation or mechanical system, we suggest value adds.
 
Basis of design - Use industry accepted technique to lay out projects or their concept to ensure end user functionality. We ensure goals and direction using this documentation for the project/program.
 
Design & Construction - We design a system that is fully implementable for an integrator and fabricator with our experience for the specific vertical. We ensure communication between the designer and boots on the ground.
 
Manage - Single point of contact for communication with a firm handle on scope, schedule, and price for all parties involved.
 
Commission - From basis of design through documentation, oversight, and testing to ensure a positive outcome from a trusted third party. The stamp of approval saying the system is aligned with the scope and the operation expected.
