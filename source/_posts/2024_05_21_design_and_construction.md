# Design & Construction

A new design is an invigorating part of our team’s offering.  Something from nothing is about to take shape, and we get a chance to dictate our visions.  But just because we control the destiny of our own drawings, specifications, etc. does not mean we blindly ignore the rest of the design and construction teams!  Communication drives our team from the very beginning to lay out our scope of the design.  We strive to create an eloquent and inclusive design package that promotes the ease of construction, documentation aiding the trades and integrators, and well-coordinated communication between the other designers we interact with.

Controls can be a neglected scope in design, often due to the amazing efforts of individuals working for an integrator.  These individuals routinely apply their trade to mechanical and electrical equipment, from multiple manufacturers that were not specified with compatibility in mind.  It is an unnecessary stress our team has lived through bailing projects out.  These efforts can be misleading to decision makers, and as a result, great risk arises from the availability of certain individuals for a project.  We believe engineering the applicable solution alongside other disciplines removes risk, and stress.

Our core designers have experience from multiple verticals and positions within the design/construction environment.  Pulling from the experience of machine design within OEM’s, we look to create standardization and ease of manufacturing into our work.  These standards are often customer specific, and though present in the verticals we thrive in, these unique experiences elevate quality and reliability.  The small team mindset from these previous projects where individuals were accountable for specification, design for all disciplines, oversight of manufacturing, programming, factory witness testing, field startup, and commissioning is exemplified in the designs we create.  It has allowed our team to work on mega project programs for hyperscalers or the care and attention of much smaller scale projects lacking a big-time budget.

We stress communication and learning through the design process.  Simple discussions to ensure areas of risk are reviewed or areas of consideration are thought about with other disciplines during the design phase yields massive results.  We are focused on the end users/operators during this phase to ensure the system will operate as intended.  Fundamentals and hardening of the system cannot be neglected either.  One such instance, that has surfaced on multiple projects for multiple end users; we received feedback from electrical design engineers, on how to fix an issue.  Each provided different reasoning, but we discovered it was a minor low voltage electrical oversite that drove two very different solutions by integrators.  It was a bandage over the core issue causing higher costs and adding unnecessary complexity and points of failure.  And it all came from a lack of up-front design and coordination in their controls.

We love design, we embrace it!  New or existing installations or buildings.  Our offering is not new, but our approach, experience, and attitude is what sets us apart.  We want to remove the long days for tradespersons and integrators working tirelessly to hit unrealistic deadlines.  Our dream is to educate others with what we have learned and prove there is a better way.
